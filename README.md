# Python-Challenges
### Python Scripts to Analyze Financial Records and Election Data

> Use Python to write a sctipt that reads a preset CSV file, outputs an analysis in the terminal and export a TXT file with the analysis to a preset folder.

## Background - Requirements - PyBank
> In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

> Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- Your analysis should align with the following results:
```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
```
## Answer and Process

> See [PyBank main.py](./PyBank/main.py) for Python script solution and notes in code.

| Step | Description |
|--------------|---------------|
| 1. Establish Variables | We know that the instructions require us provide a certain set of values. We esablish those as variables. |
| 2. Pathing for CSV | We need to import `os` and `csv` to read csv files. We set a filepath to the correct folder where the dataset lives. to confirm that the script found the file, we create a print test that will print the path. |
| 3. Reading the CSV | After some attempts, we read the data using `csv.reader` and test to ensure we read properly by making print tests. |
| 4. Processing the Data | First, we skip the headers. Second, we create a for loop that reads each row in the data individually. in this for loop, we cound the rows to get total months, we find the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and gather the differences between the changes in a list. This list is divided by the count of values to get an average change.|
| 5. Data Print and TXT export | Using `print` we make an output that matches the requirements in the instructions. We use `str` or `f` to ensure integers print as strings. For export, we provide the script with a path and test the path before using `.write` to make the txt file that matches the requirements set by the instructions. |
