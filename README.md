### Python Scripts to Analyze Financial Records and Election Data

> Use Python to write a sctipt that reads a preset CSV file, outputs an analysis in the terminal and export a TXT file with the analysis to a preset folder.

## Background - Requirements - PyBank
> In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

> Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
